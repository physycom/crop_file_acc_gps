# crop_file_acc_gps
Simply parses all files in a folder, making a copy containing a selected time window.
Files should follow the structure:

``time value1 value2 value3`

A subfolder "crop" will be created, and files with only the selected time window will be created inside it.

Only works via command line arguments.

`croppa_file_acc_gps.exe folder_name`
